/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AutoFlow CRM.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user has complete control over their own data, and no access to other users' data.  It leverages path-based authorization and data denormalization for efficient and secure access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership. Deals, Contacts, Tasks, and Gmail Integrations are stored as subcollections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data, enforced by `isOwner(userId)`.
 * - Listing other users' data is forbidden.
 * - Data required for authorization is denormalized onto documents to avoid expensive `get()` calls in security rules.
