# **App Name**: AutoFlow CRM

## Core Features:

- Voice-to-CRM: Record voice notes directly into the app. AI transcribes the audio and updates relevant CRM records (contacts, deals, tasks) automatically.
- Zero-Click Inbox: Review AI-generated suggestions for CRM updates based on processed voice notes and email interactions, then approve or reject updates.
- Automated Email Integration: Connect Gmail to automatically extract relevant information and transform interactions into structured CRM data. It identifies contacts, extracts action items, and schedules follow-ups.
- Smart CRM View: Display automatically-created deals and contacts in an organized format. Sort the display according to various metrics, like close date and deal size.
- Natural Language Search: Search CRM data using natural language queries. The AI tool understands queries like 'deals sin respuesta en 10 días' to quickly retrieve specific information.
- Settings & Integrations: Configure integrations with other services (e.g., Gmail), customize language settings, and manage privacy settings.
- Home Dashboard: A dashboard providing an overview of recent processed data, quick access to voice recording, and a summary of upcoming tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Mint Green (#61D8C4) to convey trust, intelligence, and efficiency.
- Background color: White(#FFFFF), a desaturated variant of the primary, for a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Dark Orange (#C88225) to highlight calls to action and important information. It's analogous to blue but contrasts with it for clear visual separation.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent different CRM functions (contacts, deals, tasks, settings).
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for displaying information, ensuring clarity and ease of use. Favor left-aligned text and controls.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and to guide users through the workflow, without being distracting.
